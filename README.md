## 4. Installation

### 4.1 CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 1.1.0+ is required to build ViSearchWidgets.

Go to your Xcode project directory to create an empty Podfile:

```
pod init
```

To integrate ViSearchWidgets into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'ViSearchWidgets', '~> 0.1'
end
```
You should change version 0.1 to the latest version of ViSearchWidgets. The version numbers can be viewed under the current Github project tags.

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### 4.2 Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

Alternately, you can download and run the `Carthage.pkg` file for the latest [release](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases). 

To integrate ViSearchWidgets into your Xcode project using Carthage:

1. Create a `Cartfile` :

 ```ogdl
 github "visenze/visearch-widget-swift" ~> 0.1
 ```
 You should change version 0.1 to the latest version of ViSearchWidgets. The version numbers can be viewed under the current Github project tags.

2. Run `carthage update --platform iOS --no-use-binaries`. 

 This will fetch dependencies into Carthage/Checkouts folder, then build the framework. 

3. Drag the built `ViSearchWidgets.framework` into your Xcode project.

 * [TODO] Add framework search path


### 4.3 App Permission

- **Add Privacy Usage Description** :

 iOS 10 now requires user permission to access camera and photo library. If your app requires these access, please add description for NSCameraUsageDescription, NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription in the Info.plist. More details can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW24).
